# This is a personal log.

I already know python since 19forgotten.

I've used it in thesis last 2012.  
I've used it to automate stupid annoying corporate tasks since 2016 up to present.

Despite these, I still feel like I didn't really study the language.

I just make programs that "run", without knowing if it is "right".  
Cue in: Clean Code and the entire software engineering shenagigans.

This is before ChatGPT and all the GenAI chatbots became popular.
Yes, we already made shitty programs that _**just runs**_.

So, now, we're starting again.

_Actually I already started studying the basics last 2016, but I got sidetracked... because... **life**._
